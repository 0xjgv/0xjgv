### About me
Hi, I'm Juan, a self-taught software engineer with a love for product development and a diverse background in web, data, cybersecurity, and reverse engineering. Currently, I'm channeling my skills into **epilot**, where we're pioneering a new era for energy providers. Think of it as Shopify for the energy sector, simplifying how products and services are managed and sold.

When the sun sets, my curiosity rises. I'm deeply engrossed in exploring LLM/ML libraries, always on the lookout for new knowledge and interesting projects to bring to life.

### Side Hustles and Innovations:
- [**Cypherblock**](https://cypherblock.xyz/) - A streamlined API that evaluates Ethereum addresses for fraud risk by assigning trust scores and consolidating scam data, enhancing web3 security.
- [**Fredirect**](https://fredirect.vercel.app/) - A tool that tracks and analyzes URL redirects to spot harmful or fake links, keeping you safe from online impersonation threats.
