### Hi, I'm Juan.

I‚Äôm a self-taught, product-minded software engineer with a background in web development, cybersecurity and reverse engineering. 

By day I work as a Senior Software Engineer at ~~MoonPay~~ **Cypherblock** where I, alone for the time being, build a tool that helps individuals and companies prevent fraud in web3 by assigning a trust-score to a wallet. Feel free to check it out [**cypherblock.xyz**](https://cypherblock.xyz/)

By night I love to learn new things, currently I'm tinkering with auto ML libraries, and build things that I find interesting

- [**Fredirect**](https://fredirect.vercel.app/) - Follow URL redirections to identify potential phishing websites
- [**cypherblock.xyz**](https://cypherblock.xyz/) - As mentioned ‚òùÔ∏è
- [WIP] [**YouTube-transcripts**](https://github.com/juan-villamizar/youtube-transcripts) - A tool to download a channels' video transcripts
