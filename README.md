### Hi, I'm Juan.

I‚Äôm a self-taught, product-minded software engineer with a background in web development, cybersecurity, and reverse engineering. 

By day I work as a Software Engineer at **Cypherblock** where I, alone for the time being, build a tool to help individuals & companies prevent fraud in web3 by assigning a trust score to a wallet. Feel free to check it out [**cypherblock.xyz**](https://cypherblock.xyz/).

By night I love to learn new things, currently tinkering with auto ML libraries, and building things that I find interesting.

- [**cypherblock.xyz**](https://cypherblock.xyz/) - As mentioned ‚òùÔ∏è
- [**Fredirect**](https://fredirect.vercel.app/) - Follow URL redirections to identify potential phishing websites
- [WIP] [**YouTube-transcripts**](https://github.com/juan-villamizar/youtube-transcripts) - A tool to download a channels' video transcripts
