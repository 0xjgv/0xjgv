### About me
Hey, I'm Juan, a software engineer with a passion for product development. My journey spans web, data, cybersecurity, and reverse engineering. Right now, I'm driving innovation at **epilot**, where we're transforming the energy sector into something as seamless and user-friendly as Shopify.

By night, my curiosity takes over. I'm diving deep into LLM/ML libraries, constantly seeking out new knowledge and exciting projects to tackle.

### Side Hustles and Innovations:
- [**Cypherblock**](https://cypherblock.xyz/) - A streamlined API that evaluates Ethereum addresses for fraud risk by assigning trust scores and consolidating scam data, enhancing web3 security.
- [**Fredirect**](https://fredirect.vercel.app/) - A tool that tracks and analyzes URL redirects to spot harmful or fake links, keeping you safe from online impersonation threats.
